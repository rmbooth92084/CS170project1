# 8 Puzzle problem solver
 
## Description
 This was my first project in my Intro to AI class. I implemented 3 search algorithims which include uniform search, A* with Misplaced tile Heuristic, A* with Euclidian distance Heuristic. The way I used these algortithims was to solve the 8 puzzle problem with different effeciencies and compare the algorithms. Also made is so you can adjust for different sized boards but standard 8 was the intended goal for this project.
